## dat2nc
**dat2nc** is a utility program that converts a set of decomposition files (in
a text format) generated by [PIO](https://github.com/NCAR/ParallelIO) or
[Scorpio](https://github.com/E3SM-Project/scorpio) to a NetCDF CDF5 file, which
can be used as input files to the `e3sm_io` benchmark to evaluate its I/O
performance. The instructions below explain how to convert the data decomposition
file into the NetCDF file.
* For the F case, there are three unique data decomposition maps, thus three
  `.dat` files, generated during E3SM production runs. The `.dat` files are in the
  text format. Converting the decomposition maps and merged into a single NetCDF
  file enables `e3sm_io` to read the decomposition maps in parallel.
* For the G case, there are 6 unique decomposition maps, thus 6 `.dat` files.
* For the I case, there are 5 unique decomposition map files.
* Utility program, `dat2nc.c`, can be built by running command `make`, which will
  build the executable file named `dat2nc`.
* In addition to converting the text-based decomposition maps into NetCDF array
  variables, `dat2nc` also performs the following tasks.
  + **Removes 0 offsets** -
    In a decomposition map `.dat` file, the index starts from 1, i.e. a Fortran
    convension. Indices with 0 values indicate the process does not write to any
    element. They can be ignored and hence are removed in the output NetCDF file.
  + **Coalesces consecutive offsets** -
    The decomposition map records the offsets of individual array elements
    accessed by a process. `dat2nc` detects consecutive offsets and merges them
    into a contiguous access region, represented by a pair of offset and length.
  + **Option -s** - Sorts the offset and length pairs into an increasing order
    of offsets. The offsets in a decomposition map generated from PIO or
    Scorpio are **NOT** necessarily sorted in an increasing order.
  + **Option -r** - The original decomposition maps, i.e. offsets only, can
    also be included in the NetCDF file if using the command-line option `-r`.
    When this option is enabled, `dat2nc` will save a copy of the original
    decomposition maps into variables with prefix name "raw_".
  + **Option -f** - Assigns the uncovered elements in decomposition maps. Not
    all decomposition maps cover the enire array elements they decompose.

* Three decomposition map files from a small E3SM F case running 16 MPI processes
  are provided in folder [datasets](../datasets).
  * `piodecomp16tasks16io01dims_ioid_514.dat`  (decomposition along the fastest dimensions)
  * `piodecomp16tasks16io01dims_ioid_516.dat`  (decomposition along the fastest dimensions)
  * `piodecomp16tasks16io02dims_ioid_548.dat`  (decomposition along the fastest two dimensions)
* The input file to `dat2nc` is a text file contains a list of decomposition map
  file names. An example is provided in [./input_files_f_case.txt](input_files_f_case.txt).
  ```console
  % cat ./input_files_f_case.txt
  ../datasets/piodecomp16tasks16io01dims_ioid_514.dat
  ../datasets/piodecomp16tasks16io01dims_ioid_516.dat
  ../datasets/piodecomp16tasks16io02dims_ioid_548.dat
  ```
* The command to convert and combine the three `.dat` files from the small F case
  example to a NetCDF file is:
  ```console
  % ./dat2nc -i input_files_f_case.txt -o map_f_case_16p.nc
  ```
* Full list of command-line options of `./dat2nc`:
  ```console
  % ./dat2nc -h
  Usage: dat2nc [-h|-v|-r|-f|-s|-l num] -i input_file -o out_file
  -h             Print help
  -v             Verbose mode
  -r             Include original decomposition maps
  -f             Fill in unassigned elements in decomposition maps
  -s             Sort offsets of decomposition maps increasingly
  -l num         max number of characters per line in input file
  -i input_file  a text file containing a list of decomposition
                 map .dat file names
  -o out_file    name of output netCDF file
  ```
* The output NetCDF file, `map_f_case_16p.nc`, converted from these 3
  decomposition `.dat` files is also provided in folder `../datasets`.
  Its metadata can be obtained from running NetCDF utility program `ncdump`
  or `ncmpidump` and is shown below.

## dat2decomp
**dat2decomp** is generalized from [dat2nc](#dat2nc) to convert the
decomposition map .dat files into HDF5, NetCDF4, or BP file format, in addition
to the NetCDF classic 64-bit data format. The instructions below explain how to
convert the data decomposition map files into CDF5, HDF5, NetCDF4, or ADIOS file
format.
* Running command `make` under to root folder should have created the
  executable `dat2decomp` in folder `utils`.
  + Use -a option to select the output file format.
    + cdf5 - NetCDF CDF5 file format, same as `dat2nc`
    + hdf5 - HDF5 format
    + netcdf4 - NetCDF 4 format
    + bp - ADIOS2 BP format
  + 
* The command to combine the three `.dat` files for the small F case to a HDF5
  file is:
  ```console
  % ./dat2decomp -a hdf5 -i input_files_f_case.txt -o map_f_case_16p.nc
  ```
* Command-line options of `./dat2decomp`:
  ```console
  % ./dat2decomp -h
  Usage: ./dat2decomp [-h|-v|-r|-f|-s|-l num] -a fmt -i input_file -o out_file
  -h             Print help
  -v             Verbose mode
  -r             Include original decomposition maps
  -f             Fill in unassigned elements in decomposition maps
  -s             Sort offsets of decomposition maps increasingly
  -l num         max number of characters per line in input file
  -a fmt         output file format, fmt is one of the followings
     cdf5:       NetCDF classic 64-bit data format
     netcdf4:    NetCDF-4 (HDF5-based) format
     hdf5:       HDF5 format
     bp:         ADIOS2 BP format
  -i input_file  a text file containing a list of decomposition
                 map .dat file names
  -o out_file    output file name
  ```
---

## decomp_copy
**decomp_copy** copies a decomposition file already in the NetCDF CDF5, HDF5,
NetCDF4, or ADIOS BP format to a new file in a different format.
* Note that `e3sm_io` must be configured with the API options enabled for the
  corresponding input and output file formats. For instance, to convert a
  NetCDF CDF5 file to an HDF5 file, `e3sm_io` must be configured with
  `--with-pnetcdf` and `--with-hdf5`. Below is an example command.
  ```console
  % ./decomp_copy -a hdf5 -i map_f_case_16p.nc -o map_f_case_16p.h5
  ```
* Command-line options of `./decomp_copy`:
  ```console
  % ./decomp_copy -h
  Usage: ./decomp_copy [-h|-v] -a fmt -i input_file -o out_file
     [-h]            Print help
     [-v]            verbose mode
     -a fmt          output file format, fmt is one of the followings
        cdf5:        NetCDF classic 64-bit data format
        netcdf4:     NetCDF-4 (HDF5-based) format
        hdf5:        HDF5 format
        bp:          ADIOS2 BP format
     -i input_file   input file name
     -o out_file     output file name
  ```
---

## datstat
**datstat** reads a decomposition map .dat file in its original text format and
report some statistics of the decomposition.

* Command-line options of `datstat`:
  ```console
  % ./datstat -h
  Usage: ./datstat [OPTION]...
         -h             Print help
         -d input_file  decomposition map .dat file to be analyzed
  ```

* Example run:
  ```console
    % ./datstat -d ../datasets/piodecomp16tasks16io01dims_ioid_514.dat
    =========================================================================
    Deomposition file ../datasets/piodecomp16tasks16io01dims_ioid_514.dat
    =========================================================================
    version: 2001
    npes: 16
    ndims: 1
    Dims: 866,
    total_cells: 1536
    total_zero_cells: 670
    max_cells: 96 @ rank 0
    max_zero_cells: 56 @ rank 12
    zero ratio: 0.436198
  ```

## bpstat
**bpstat** counts and displays the size of attributes and variables in an
ADIOS2 BP3 file. If the input path name is a folder containing sub-files, the
path name should be without the .dir extension.

* Command-line options of `bpstat`:
  ```console
  % ./bpstat -h
  Usage: ./bpstat [OPTION]...
         -v    Verbose mode
         -h    Print help
         path  Name of BP file or folder to be analyzed
  ```

* Example run:
  ```console
  % ./bpstat ./f_case_h0.bp
  Num subfiles: 1
  Num variables: 1203
  Total variable size: 17115880
  Num attributes: 3501
  Total attribute size: 302738
  Total object size (MiB): 16.6117
  Total object size (GiB): 0.0162224
  ```

## pnetcdf_blob_replay
**pnetcdf_blob_replay** reads the subfiles produced by the `e3sm_io` benchmark
when running with pnetcdf blob method into a single, regular NetCDF file.
Currently, it must be run with the same number of MPI processes that produced
the subfiles. The future work will remove such limitation to allow less number
of MPI processes to convert.

* Command-line options of `pnetcdf_blob_replay`:
  ```console
  % ./pnetcdf_blob_replay -h
  Usage: pnetcdf_blob_replay [OPTION]... FILE
      [-h] Print help
      [-v] Verbose mode
      -i file  Base name of input subfiles
      -o file  Output file name
  ```
* Example run:
  ```console
    % mpiexec -n 16 ./pnetcdf_blob_replay -i blob_F_out_h0.nc -o F_out_h0.nc
      Input subfile base name            = blob_F_out_h0.nc
      Output file name                   = F_out_h0.nc
      No. decompositions                 =   3
      No. variables                      = 429
