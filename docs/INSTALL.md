                  CC=mpicc CXX=mpicxx
    % make
    ```
  + The executable file, named 'e3sm_io', is created in folder 'src'.

## Prepare the Data Decomposition Map Files
* Data decomposition maps generated by the PIO library are in text format (with
  file extension name ".dat". The decomposition maps must first be combined and
  converted into a NetCDF file to be read in parallel as the input file by this
  benchmark program. For the F, G, and I cases, there are 3, 6, and 5 data
  decomposition text files, respectively.
* See [utils/README.md](../utils/README.md) for instructions to run utility programs
  + `dat2nc` converts the decomposition map .dat files to NetCDF CDF-5 files.
  + `dat2decomp` is more general utility program that can convert the
    decomposition map .dat files in text format to a CDF5/HDF5/NetCDF-4/BP
    file.
  + `decomp_copy` copies and converts a decomposition map file in an
    HDF5/NetCDF-4/BP format to a different format.

## Run command
* Example run commands using `mpiexec` and 16 MPI processes are given below.
  + Run the write test with default settings, i.e. using PnetCDF library and
    producing files storing variables in a canonical data layout.
    ```
    % mpiexec -n 16 src/e3sm_io -o can_F_out.nc datasets/f_case_866x72_16p.nc
    ```
* The number of MPI processes used to run this benchmark can be smaller than
  the one used when creating the decomposition maps, i.e. the value of variable
  `decomp_nprocs` stored in the decomposition NetCDF file. For example, in file
  `datasets/f_case_866x72_16p.nc`, the value of scalar variable `decomp_nprocs`
  is 16, which is the number of MPI processes originally used to generate the
  decomposition `.dat` files. When running this benchmark using a smaller
  number of MPI processes, the I/O workload will be divided among all the
  allocated MPI processes. When using more processes than `decomp_nprocs`, the
  processes with MPI ranks greater than or equal to `decomp_nprocs` will have
  no data to write but still participate the collective I/O in the benchmark.

* Command-line Options:
  ```
    % ./e3sm_io -h
    Usage: ./e3sm_io [OPTION] FILE
       [-h] Print this help message
       [-v] Verbose mode
       [-k] Keep the output files when program exits (default: deleted)

                      block (blob), ignoring variable's canonical order.
       FILE: Name of input file storing data decomposition maps
  ```
* Both F and I cases create two history files, referred to as 'h0' and 'h1'
  files. The supplied file name in option `-o` will be used to construct the
  output file names by inserting/appending strings "_h0" and "_h1" to indicate
  the two history files. If the input path contains file extension `.nc` or
  `.h5`, "_h0" and "_h1" will be inserted before the file extension. Otherwise,
  they will be appended at the end. See examples in "Output files" section
  below.
* When using HDF5 API (i.e. "-a hdf5" or "-a hdf5_log"), the environment
  variable `HDF5_VOL_CONNECTOR`, if used, must be set to match the I/O strategy
  used.
  + If I/O strategy is canonical, i.e. "-a hdf5 -x canonical"),
    `HDF5_VOL_CONNECTOR` must not be set to use log-based VOL.
  + If I/O strategy is log ("-x log"), `HDF5_VOL_CONNECTOR` must be set to use
    log-based VOL.  

### Current supported APIs (option `-a`) and I/O strategies (option `-x`)
  + Table below lists the supported combinations.
     |           | pnetcdf | hdf5 | hdf5_log | netcdf4* | adios |
     |-----------|:-------:|:----:|:--------:|:--------:|:-----:|
     | canonical | yes     | yes  | no       | yes      | no    |
     | log       | no      | yes  | yes      | yes      | no    |
     | blob      | yes     | yes  | no       | no       | yes   |
     
     `*` NetCDF-C version 4.9.0 or newer is required.

  + **-a pnetcdf -x canonical**
    * A single NetCDF file in the classic CDF5 format will be created. All
      variables stored in the file are in the canonical order and
      understandable by NetCDF and its third-party software.
    * If the output file systems allow users to customize the file striping
      configuration, such as Lustre, users are recommended to write to a folder
      with a high file striping count to obtain a good I/O performance.
    * Example run command:
      ```
      mpiexec -n 16 src/e3sm_io datasets/f_case_866x72_16p.nc -k -o can_F_out.nc -a pnetcdf -x canonical -r 25
      ```
  + **-a pnetcdf -x blob**
    * Multiple subfiles in the NetCDF format will be created. The files conform
      with NetCDF file format specification.
    * There will be one subfile per compute node used.
    * File name provided in option `-o` will be used as a base to create the
      subfile names, which have the numerical IDs appended as the suffix.
    * Because all variables are stored in a blob fashion in the files, the
      subfiles altogether can only be understood by the conversion utility
      tool [utils/pnetcdf_blob_replay.c](../utils/pnetcdf_blob_replay.c), which
      is developed to run off-line after the completion of an E3SM run to
      convert the subfiles into a single regular NetCDF file.
    * The blobs are per-record based, which means all write requests to the
      same variable by different MPI processes are packed and stored in a
      contiguous file space, called blob. Within that blob, data layout follows
      the process rank order.
    * Example run command:
      ```
      mpiexec -n 16 src/e3sm_io datasets/f_case_866x72_16p.nc -k -o blob_F_out.nc -a pnetcdf -x blob -r 25
      ```
  + **-a hdf5 -x canonical**
    * This option writes/reads data using HDF5 APIs `H5Dwrite`/`H5Dread`.
    * The data layout of datasets store in the output file is in a canonical
      order.
    * This option will ignore environment variables `HDF5_VOL_CONNECTOR` and
      `HDF5_PLUGIN_PATH`.
    * Example run command:
      ```
      mpiexec -n 16 src/e3sm_io datasets/f_case_866x72_16p.h5 -k -o can_F_out.h5 -a hdf5 -x canonical -r 25
      ```
  + **-a hdf5_md -x canonical**
    * This option writes/reads data using HDF5 multi-dataset APIs
      `H5Dwrite_multi`/`H5Dread_multi`.
    * The data layout of datasets store in the output file is in a canonical
      order.
    * This option will ignore environment variables `HDF5_VOL_CONNECTOR` and
      `HDF5_PLUGIN_PATH`.
    * Example run command:
      ```
      mpiexec -n 16 src/e3sm_io datasets/f_case_866x72_16p.h5 -k -o can_F_out.h5 -a hdf5_md -x canonical -r 25
      ```
  + **-a hdf5 -x blob**
    * This is the blob I/O implementation using HDF5 library. Different from
      the PnetCDF blob I/O, the implementation of uses the per-process based
      blob I/O strategy, in which each process writes only one blob at file
      close time, no matter how many data sets/variables are written. All
      write requests to all variables by a process are first cached in memory
      until file close time, in which they are packed into a contiguous buffer,
      a blob, to be flushed out in a single write call. There is an additional
      write for the header data blob written by the root process only. This
      per-process based strategy is the same one used by ADIOS.
    * Multiple subfiles in HDF5 format will be created.
    * There will be one subfile per compute node used.
    * File name provided in option `-o` will be used as a base to create the
      subfile names, which have the numerical IDs appended as the suffix.
    * The HDF5 subfiles cannot be understood by the traditional HDF5 software.
      A utility tool program will be developed in the future to convert the
      subfiles into a single regular HDF5 file.
    * Example run command:
      ```
      mpiexec -n 16 src/e3sm_io datasets/f_case_866x72_16p.h5 -k -o blob_F_out.h5 -a hdf5 -x blob -r 25
      ```
  + **-a hdf5 -x log**
    * This option writes data using the HDF5 log-based VOL.
    * API "H5Dwrite" is used to write the datasets.
    * The log-based VOL stores data in a log layout, rather than a canonical
      layout. The output file is a valid HDF5 file but requires the log-based
      VOL to read and understand the data structures.
    * This option will ignore environment variables `HDF5_VOL_CONNECTOR` and `HDF5_PLUGIN_PATH`.
    * Example run command:
      ```
      mpiexec -n 16 src/e3sm_io datasets/f_case_866x72_16p.h5 -k -o can_F_out.h5 -a hdf5 -x log -r 25
      ```
  + **-a hdf5_log -x log**
    * This option writes data using the HDF5 log-based VOL and specifically
      makes use of the new API, "H5Dwrite_n", to allow writing multiple
      subarrays of a dataset in a single API call.
    * This option will ignore environment variables `HDF5_VOL_CONNECTOR` and `HDF5_PLUGIN_PATH`.
    * Example run command:
      ```
      mpiexec -n 16 src/e3sm_io datasets/f_case_866x72_16p.h5 -k -o log_F_out.h5 -a hdf5_log -x log -r 25
      ```
  + **-a netcdf4 -x canonical**
    * This option writes data using the NetCDF-4 library.
    * The output files are in HDF5 format.
    * The data layout of datasets store in the output file is in a canonical
      order.
    * Because the number of write requests are different among processes, the
      independent I/O mode is used when writing the data to files.
    * Example run command:
      ```
      mpiexec -n 16 src/e3sm_io datasets/f_case_866x72_16p.nc4 -k -o can_F_out.nc4 -a netcdf4 -x canonical -r 25
      ```
    * If environment variables `HDF5_VOL_CONNECTOR` and `HDF5_PLUGIN_PATH` are
      set to use log-based VOL, then the execution will abort, as this option
      is equivalent to the below one, i.e. `-a netcdf4 -x log`.
  + **-a netcdf4 -x log**
    * This option writes data using the NetCDF-4 library which calls the HDF5
      log-based VOL underneath.
    * The log-based VOL stores data in a log layout, rather than a canonical
      layout. The output file is a valid HDF5 file but requires the log-based
      VOL to read and understand the data structures.
    * **Requirements** - The two environment variables `HDF5_VOL_CONNECTOR` and
      `HDF5_PLUGIN_PATH` must be set to use log-based VOL in order to run. The
      e3sm_io program will check and error out if they are not set.
    * Example run command:
      ```
      export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:${HOME}/LOG_VOL/lib
      export HDF5_PLUGIN_PATH=${HOME}/LOG_VOL/lib
      export HDF5_VOL_CONNECTOR="LOG under_vol=0;under_info={}"
      mpiexec -n 16 src/e3sm_io datasets/f_case_866x72_16p.nc4 -k -o log_F_out.nc4 -a netcdf4 -x log -r 25
      ```
  + **-a adios -x blob**
    * This option writes data using the ADIOS library.
    * Multiple subfiles in BP format will be created.
    * The number of subfile is determined by command-line option `-g`.
    * File name provided in option `-o` will be used as a base to create the
      folder names which store the subfiles. The folder names will have suffix
      ".bp.dir" appended. Each subfile name in its folder will have ".bp" and a
      numerical ID appended.
    * Because all variables are stored in a blob fashion in the files, the
      subfiles can only be understood by the Scorpio's conversion utility tool,
      [adios2pio-nm](https://github.com/E3SM-Project/scorpio/tree/master/tools/adios2pio-nm),
      which is developed to run off-line to convert the subfiles into a single
      regular NetCDF file.
    * This option requires the original PIO decomposition maps in the text
      format. They can be included in the converted NetCDF decomposition file
      by adding a command-line option `-r` when running dat2nc. See README file
      in folder `utils` for more instructions. If the original decomposition
      map is not in the decomposition file, the E3SM benchmark will create it
      by expanding the offset and length pairs in the converted decomposition
      map into list of offsets accessed.
    * Example run command:
      ```
      mpiexec -n 16 src/e3sm_io datasets/f_case_866x72_16p.bp -k -o blob_F_out -a adios -x blob -r 25
      ```

## Output Files
* The above example command uses command-line option `-k` to keep the output
  files (otherwise the default is to delete them when the program exits.) For
  the F case, each run of `e3sm_io` produces two history output files whose
  names are created by inserting "_h0", and "_h1" to user-supplied file name.
  The header of F case files from running the provided decomposition file
  `f_case_866x72_16p.nc` using PnetCDF obtainable by command `ncmpidump -h` is
  available in [datasets/f_case_h0.txt](../datasets/f_case_h0.txt), and
  [datasets/f_case_h1.txt](../datasets/f_case_h1.txt).
* The G case only creates one output file. When using the PnetCDF I/O method
  and the provided decomposition file `g_case_cmpaso_16p.nc` to run, the header
  of output file can be found in [datasets/g_case_hist.txt](../datasets/g_case_hist.txt).
* The option '-a adios' automatically appends ".bp.dir" extension to the
  user-provided input path and creates two folders for F  and I cases (one for
  G case.)
  + The names of output subfiles will be appended with file extension
    ".bp.dir".
